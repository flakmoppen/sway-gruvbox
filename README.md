# **Dotfiles**
**Dotfiles for a minimalistic gruvbox themed sway with waybar.**  
Made for a laptop that was old when this world was young.

## Stylings
### Waybar
**CSS**  
Even though I'm using Gruvbox's light color palette right now, I also added its dark palette in waybars *styles.css*, in case I would feel like switching it up tomorrow.

**Icons**  
I found it cumbersome to fit Font Awesome into the formatting I was going for, so I'm using Nerd Font Symbols Mono instead.  
*(For example: The battery icon set is 'nf-md-battery' on [Nerd Font glyph search](https://www.nerdfonts.com/cheat-sheet).*

**Icons + CSS examples**  
When unplugging the battery cable, the battery field gets a red gradient:

When at < 20%, the icon turns red:

When at < 10%, the icon starts blinking:

When charging, the battery gets a tiny flash icon and the field gets a green gradient:
